# Basic-Banking-Website
This is a basic banking website where you can make transactions, view customer details and access transaction histories.
I made this in my tenure of internship with The Sparks Foundation. In this project, I have created a basic website and hosted it with the help of xampp server.
The Bank is named as Securevault with its home page containing options like transfer money, view all customers, view transaction history followed by guidelines.
When a user intends to transfer money, user has to select sender, reciever and write the amount, once the transaction is successful a transaction successful message will come and user can see it in the transaction history with account number and name of sender and reciever, amount of money, transaction status and time at the time of transaction.
The View all customer page comprises of all the details of the users of the Securevault.
All the pages have Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions of Securevault at the bottom.
The Contact us page will provide you with the necessary details to reach to Securevault.
The About us pages gives a brief description of the developer and The Sparks Foundation.
